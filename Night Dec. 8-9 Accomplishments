1. All JButtons changed to JRadioButtons
2. Action listener segment for JRadioButtons for lobbyPanel created in PenteClient (no specific code yet)
3. **NEEDED** A getter for retrieving the arrays of players and games lobbyPanel reference in NewPenteWindow 
4. Getter method in lobbyPanel for retrieving playerButtons_ and gameButtons_ Hashtables
5. Set up action listeners for buttons in lobbyPanel (NOT SURE IF THIS IS CORRECT)
6. Player and game methods shared with PenteClient
7. **RECOMMENDATION** place player and game buttons in a button group so limit selections to one per group
