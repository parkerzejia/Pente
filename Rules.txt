OBJECT OF THE GAME:
Win by placing five (or more) of your stones in a row, vertically, horizontally, 
or diagonally, with no empty points between them. Or, win by capturing five (or more) 
pairs of your opponent's stones.

HOW TO PLAY:
Play starts with the board completely clear of stones. The first player (black) begins 
the game by playing one stone on the center point. Thereafter the players take turns 
placing their stones, one at a time, on any empty intersection. The stones are placed 
on the intersections of the lines (including the very edge of the board), rather than 
in the squares. Once played, a stone cannot be moved again, except when removed by a 
capture. Players alternate turns adding new stones to the board, building up their 
positions, until one player wins.

CAPTURES:
Whenever your opponent has two stones (and only two) which are adjacent, those stones 
are vulnerable to capture. The pair can be captured by bracketing its two ends with 
your own stones. The captured stones are removed from the board.

Captures can be made vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, and multiple captures 
can occur on a single move.

WINNING THE GAME:
The game ends immediately when one player captures five pairs, or places five stones 
in a row. The opposing player has no last chance to make a final move.
When a player obtains an unblocked row of four stones, called a tessera, a win is imminent. 
Therefore, an unblocked row of three stones, called a tria, is a serious 
threat that should be blocked unless a stronger offensive move exists. An unblocked 
row of three stones, if it contains one gap, is still considered a tria. 

ETIQUETTE:
It is a customary, but not mandatory, refinement of this game to announce tria or tessera when moving to make an open three, and also to call tria or tessera when making four
in a row.
